}
\arguments{
\item{mode}{Computation mode.}

\item{input_vars}{character. Vector of column names to use.}

\item{cutoff_dist}{numeric(1). Cutoff distance. Should be positive.}

\item{cutoff_weightd}{numeric(1). Cutoff value of distance weight when \code{mode \%in\% c("CDE", "DE")} Below this value will be truncated to zero.}

\item{cutoff_weightc}{numeric(1). Cutoff value of distance weight when \code{mode \%in\% c("CDE", "CE")} Below this value will be truncated to zero.}

\item{bandwidth}{numeric(1). Bandwidth distance to cutoff nearby features beyond the given value. Polygon inputs will be represented by their centroids.}

\item{q_jsd}{numeric(1). Quantile of Jensen-Shannon divergence to apply cutoffs. Should be bounded [0, 1]}

\item{kneigh}{integer(1). Number of the nearest neighbors to select nearby features.}

\item{queen}{logical(1). Queen's (sharing a vertex) or Rook's (sharing a line segment) contiguity for polygon spatial data.}

\item{sup_factor}{numeric(1). Custom weight to compromise distance-based weights and Jensen-Shannon divergence. Should be bounded [0, 1].}
}
\description{
Initial implementation of SpEED. Users can choose contiguity-based, distance-based, and mixed spatial relation to get SpEED.
